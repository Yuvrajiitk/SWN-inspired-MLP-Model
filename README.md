# SWN-inspired-MLP-Model
Implemented a sparse MLP using Newmanâ€“Watts topology with pruning, long-range links, and hybrid training via Ridge Regression and SGD. Achieved 65.18% accuracy on CIFAR-10, outperforming the dense baseline by 1.26%, while reducing active parameters by 10% without altering original hyperparameters.
